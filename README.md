[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](https://github.com/sdslabs/watchdog/blob/master/LICENSE.md)

Watchdog is a personalised server access management tool (and a slack bot) which keeps a track of all the administrative rights attempts (like sudo and su) on server (via SSH) and allows/disallows log-in attempts based on public key of user and logs all activity in form of slack message. It provides easy granting/revoking access to servers to team members through pull requests on a keyhouse repository.

* Stateless and serverless. Watchdog runs on a single binary.
* Optional server activity logs to your favourite workspace like Slack or Discord.
* Easy Installation and Configuration
* Get notified when someone escalates privileges or performs administrative tasks using `sudo` or `su`

## Dependencies

The following softwares are required for running Watchdog:-

* PAM
* OpenSSH server

## Installation

1. Create a Keyhouse Repository using the template repository [here](https://github.com/sdslabs/keyhouse-template).

2. Clone the watchdog repository

    `git clone https://github.com/sdslabs/watchdog.git`

3. Change into the repository directory and build the latest binaries using Cargo

    `cargo build --release`

4. Copy `sample.config.toml` to `config.toml` and make changes to the config this way:

    ```toml
    # Hostname of the machine running watchdog. Note that this should be
    # same as the file you create in the `hosts` directory in keyhouse.
    hostname = 'virtual-machine'

    # Keyhouse repository configuration
    [keyhouse]

    # URL of the Keyhouse repository, it should be of the format
    # `https://api.github.com/repos/<ORGANIZATION>/<KEYHOUSE-REPOSITORY>/contents`
    base_url = 'https://api.github.com/repos/sdslabs/keyhouse-template/contents'

    # This should be a personal access token made by a member of organization on his/her
    # behalf who can read the Keyhouse repository. Go to this
    # https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?description=Keyhouse%20Token&scopes=repo
    # to make a new token with correct scopes.
    token = 'secret_token'

    # Webhook APIs corresponding to various notifiers
    [notifiers]

    # Make an incoming hook to your Slack workspace from this
    # app(https://slack.com/apps/A0F7XDUAZ-incoming-webhooks)
    # and paste the hook URL here. You can customize the icon and name as you like.
    slack = 'https://hooks.slack.com/services/ABCDEFGHI/ABCDEFGHI/abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwx'
    ```

5. Once you are done configuring, run this command with root(sudo) privileges

    `cd install && sudo ./install.sh`

6. Add `/opt/watchdog/bin` to your PATH variable.
